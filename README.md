# responsive-portfolio-homework

This was an assignment for DU's coding bootcamp. In this assignment, we were to make a website to display our portfolio. The website includes an about me page, a page displaying our portfolio, and a page with a contact form. The page is mostly styled with bootstrap's CSS with some style overrides of my own. The website is also mobile responsive so that it is aesthetically appealing in many browser sizes. 

## The functional site can be found here:
